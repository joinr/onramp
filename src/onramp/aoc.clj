;;Problems are not explicitly included here since AOC
;;generates custom test data for each user.

;;Since it is somewhat competitive (for the top n entries),
;;there is some discretion involved when solving current
;;year problems and trying to get on the leaderboard, so
;;solutions aren't necessarily shared in realtime.

;;However, the puzzles are archived (as is a user's progress).

;;I highly recommend trying to accomplish the first ~10 days.
;;Each day is broken into 2 parts, with a problem statement
;;and test data.  Part 1 typically admits brute forcing
;;and simplistic solutions (which is great for learning
;;a language), while part 2 tweaks the requirement to
;;add an algorithmic or data modeling twist (which is
;;great for learning).  You can do any day, any part,
;;in relative isolation (although there are "themes"
;;that tend to build on prior day insights).

;;https://adventofcode.com/2023 was great.  go try
;;to solve some.
