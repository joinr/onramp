;; A second problem (classic): Four people come to a river in the night. There
;; is a narrow bridge, but it can only hold two people at a time. They have one
;; torch and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing the
;; bridge.

;; Person A can cross the bridge in one minute, B in two minutes, C in five
;; minutes, and D in eight minutes. When two people cross the bridge together,
;; they must move at the slower person's pace.

;;The question is, can they all get across the bridge in 15 minutes or less?
